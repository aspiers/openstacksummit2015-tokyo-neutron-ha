The year was
# 2012
Note: ... early 2012, to be exact.


The world was a
# different
place
Note: ... for a variety of reasons.


# iPhones
had a
### majority market share


# Eucalyptus
was still
### a thing


# Ceph
was
## new


# Inktank
did not
## exist


# I
was in
## San Francisco


... and I was
# confused.


I found myself
# arguing


over whether
# OpenStack
needed
## High Availability


<!-- WTF? / Capt. Picard -->


and the
## opposing argument
was


# "It's hard."


<!-- "That escalated quickly." / "Double facepalm" -->


<!-- Angry Picard -->


Fast-forward to
# today


# Are We There Yet?
